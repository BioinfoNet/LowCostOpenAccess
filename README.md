# Publishing open access at low cost: what are our options?
In most Kenyan Institutions, students are required to publish at least one paper at MSc level. The common question is: where do we publish at low cost? To help students and early career scientists take decisions on where to publish, we create this open resource that can be used to guide students and early career researchers in Africa to publish open access, and at subsidized or waived article processing charge.

We tackled this question during an [OpenScienceKE hackathon](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon) held on 30th and 31st August 2018. The contributors to this project can be found [here](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Openaccess-Options#team-members). See [this section](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Openaccess-Options#how-to-contribute) and the [data entry guidelines](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/Openaccess-Options/blob/master/Data-Entry-Guidelines.md) if you'd like to contribute. 

Here is a summary of what we found during the hackathon:
- Most Open Access publishers offer waivers or subsidies to authors from developing countries. 
- For some, the waiver policy is linked to the corresponding author or the source of research funds. 
- Lower Income countries authors receive full waivers, while Lower middle-income countries receive a 50% subsidy. 
- Journals also consider waiver requests on a case by case basis
- Kenya is part of developing countries
- Kenya is a Lower-Middle Income country
- No special waiver to students identified so far, but may be part of the case by case waivers

## Preprints

Preprint Name|Description
---|---
[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)|A free online archive and distribution service for unpublished preprints in the life sciences. Authors use the bioRxiv service to make their manuscripts available as “preprints” before peer review, allowing other scientists to see, discuss, and comment on the findings immediately.
[AfricArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/africarxiv)|This is specially designed for African scientists to share their research outputs.
